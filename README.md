•	Created a Python command-line tool, to automate multiple traceroute executions and analyze latency statistics for each hop toward a specified target.
•	Implemented support for reading pre-generated traceroute output traces, enabling repeatable tests without live traceroute execution.
•	Developed the tool to output latency statistics in JSON format and generate a boxplot graph illustrating latency distribution per hop in PDF format.
